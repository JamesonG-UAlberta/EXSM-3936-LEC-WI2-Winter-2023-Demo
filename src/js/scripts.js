/*
You are to write classes that will simulate a pen. The class should implement a constructor. The penâ€™s ink level property should always initialize to 100 (representing a percentage). Other properties should be passed in through constructor parameters. 

The properties of the pen class should include its brand, colour and ink level. The method of the pen class should be a method to write with the pen (a single parameter representing the number of letters to write) which will subtract 0.5% of the ink per letter. If there is insufficient ink to write the prescribed number of letters, an exception should be thrown. 


Once your class is constructed, using the browser console, create a script that will (remember to catch potential exceptions):
Instantiate a pen.
Write 100 letters.
Write 42 letters.
Attempt to write 200 letters.
Output the remaining amount of ink to the console.
No user input is required.
